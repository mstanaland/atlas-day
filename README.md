# Atlas Day
**Atlas Day** is a minimal, light-colored theme based on [Atlassian's color pallette](https://atlassian.design/guidelines/brand/color).

**Note: I've only worked to support React-based front-end development. Pull requests are welcome if you'd like to add support for languages other than Javascript.**


## Motivation
I typically don't like light themes, but if you're in an environment with lots of windows and light, the screen glare can make working with your favorite dark theme untenable. But light themes are tough because its hard to have visual-interest and color differentiation and maintain readability. 

I also struggle with VS Code's noise. There's so much going on and stuff is lighting up all the time. This theme also quiets as much as that down as I could manage. So if you're coming from Sublime Text or Atom, things will feel a bit more familiar.
